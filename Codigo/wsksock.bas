'Visual Basic 4.0 Winsock "Header"
'   Alot of the information contained inside this file was originally
'   obtained from ALT.WINSOCK.PROGRAMMING and most of it has since been
'   modified in some way.
'
'Disclaimer: This file is public domain, updated periodically by
'   Topaz, SigSegV@mail.utexas.edu, Use it at your own risk.
'   Neither myself(Topaz) or anyone related to alt.programming.winsock
'   may be held liable for its use, or misuse.
'
'Declare check Aug 27, 1996. (Topaz, SigSegV@mail.utexas.edu)
'   All 16 bit declarations appear correct, even the odd ones that
'   pass longs inplace of in_addr and char buffers. 32 bit functions
'   also appear correct. Some are declared to return integers instead of
'   longs (breaking MS's rules.) however after testing these functions I
'   have come to the conclusion that they do not work properly when declared
'   following MS's rules.
'
'NOTES:
'   (1) I have never used WS_SELECT (select), therefore I must warn that I do
'       not know if fd_set and timeval are properly defined.
'   (2) Alot of the functions are declared with "buf as any", when calling these
'       functions you may either pass strings, byte arrays or UDT's. For 32bit I
'       I recommend Byte arrays and the use of memcopy to copy the data back out
'   (3) The async functions (wsaAsync*) require the use of a message hook or
'       message window control to capture messages sent by the winsock stack. This
'       is not to be confused with a CallBack control, The only function that uses
'       callbacks is WSASetBlockingHook()
'   (4) Alot of "helper" functions are provided in the file for various things
'       before attempting to figure out how to call a function, look and see if
'       there is already a helper function for it.
'   (5) Data types (hostent etc) have kept there 16bit definitions, even under 32bit
'       windows due to the problem of them not working when redfined following the
'       suggested rules.
